Polymosphism 
=> Polymosphism = poly(many)+Morphism(From)

=> One name and its multiple from is called Polymosphism.
=> in Polymorphism using single component we can perform more then 1 Operation. 
=> for example key of mobile phone, using singlr key of mobile ohone , we can type multiple alphabates.
Note: All the concept of Polymorphismare implement context of method / Constructor.

Type of Polymorphism
=> there are 2 type of Polymorphism

1. Compile time Polymorphism
2. Run time Polymorphism

Compile time Polymorphism
=> In this all the used method should be bind at tha time of compilation , so it is also called 
   Early Bindiding

ther are three way to compile time Polymorphism

1. Method overload
2. Constructor Overload.
3. *Operator Overloading

Operator Overloading :
=> Operator Overloading allow to have more then one operation for and existion operator.
=> Java does not support operator overloading programimg due to Scurity . but there are two
   operators (+,-) which are already overload.

Method Overloading:
